Deprecated

##This Toolkit is now deprecated and is superseded by [Windows Azure Mobile Services](http://www.windowsazure.com/android).

The Windows Azure Toolkit for Android provided developers with the first iteration of support for building backend services for Android apps using Windows Azure.  The main areas of feedback we received from mobile developers was that they wanted a turn-key set of services for common functionality such as notifications, auth, and data.  [Windows Azure Mobile Services](http://www.windowsazure.com/android) directly reflects this feedback by enabling developers to simpily provision, configure, and consume scalable backend services.  All future improvements will be channeled into Windows Azure Mobile Services rather than this toolkit.

Windows Azure Toolkit for Android - v1.0.0
===

The Windows Azure Toolkit for Android is a toolkit for developers to make it easy to work with Windows Azure from native Android applications.  The toolkit can be used for native Android applications developed using Eclipse and the Android SDK.

The toolkit works in two ways – the toolkit can be used to access Windows Azure storage directly, or alternatively, can go through a proxy server.  The proxy server code is the same code as used in the [Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone](http://watwp.codeplex.com) and negates the need for the developer to store the Windows Azure storage credentials locally on the device.  If you are planning to test using the proxy server, you’ll need to download and deploy the services found in the [cloudreadypackages](https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Toolkits/wa-toolkit-cloudreadypackages) here on GitHub.  

The Windows Azure Toolkit for Android is made available as an open source product under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
