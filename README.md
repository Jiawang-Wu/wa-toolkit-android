Windows Azure Toolkit for Android - v1.0.0
===

The Windows Azure Toolkit for Android is a toolkit for developers to make it easy to work with Windows Azure from native Android applications.  The toolkit can be used for native Android applications developed using Eclipse and the Android SDK.

The toolkit works in two ways – the toolkit can be used to access Windows Azure storage directly, or alternatively, can go through a proxy server.  The proxy server code is the same code as used in the [Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone](http://watwp.codeplex.com) and negates the need for the developer to store the Windows Azure storage credentials locally on the device.  If you are planning to test using the proxy server, you’ll need to download and deploy the services found in the [cloudreadypackages](https://github.com/WindowsAzure-Toolkits/wa-toolkit-cloudreadypackages) here on GitHub.  

The Windows Azure Toolkit for Android is made available as an open source product under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
